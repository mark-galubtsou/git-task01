There’s nothing I can say to you 
Nothing I could ever do to make you see 
What you mean to me 
All the pain the tears they cry 
Still you never said goodbye and now I know how far you’d go
I know I let you down but its not like that now 
This time I’ll never let you go 
I will be all that you want and get my self together 
Cause you keep me from falling apart 
All my life I’ll be with you forever 
To get you through the day and make everything ok
